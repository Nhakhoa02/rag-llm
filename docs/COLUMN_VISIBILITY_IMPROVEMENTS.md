# CSV Column Visibility Improvements

## Problem Statement

The original CSV reasoning system had a critical issue where:
1. **AI Summary Generation**: The AI summary correctly analyzed and documented all columns of CSV tables during initial processing
2. **Search/Query Process**: When performing searches, the system was not properly passing all column information to the SQL generation process, causing the AI to only see and use a limited subset of columns

This resulted in incomplete SQL queries that missed relevant columns, leading to suboptimal search results.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in several key areas:

### 1. Limited Column Information in Prompts
- The SQL generation prompts only included basic column lists
- Missing detailed column metadata (data types, unique counts, missing values)
- No comprehensive column context for the AI model

### 2. Incomplete Schema Extraction
- API endpoints only extracted basic column names
- Missing data types, unique counts, and other schema metadata
- Limited sample size for schema analysis

### 3. Restricted Column Mapping
- Column mapping generation was too conservative
- Only mapped the most obvious columns
- Missing contextual and supporting columns

### 4. Basic SQL Query Generation
- Limited column selection logic
- No intelligent column expansion based on query context
- Missing pattern matching for related columns

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSV Schema Extraction (`src/api/main.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Only extracted basic column names
columns = doc["metadata"].get("columns", [])
available_csvs.append({
    "file_path": csv_name,
    "schema": {"columns": columns},
    "db_path": db_path
})
```

**After:**
```python
# Comprehensive schema extraction with metadata
schema = {
    "columns": columns,
    "column_types": column_types,
    "unique_counts": unique_counts,
    "missing_values": missing_values,
    "row_count": len(documents) * 1000,
    "column_count": len(columns)
}
```

### 2. Enhanced SQL Generation Prompts (`src/ai/csv_reasoning_engine.py`)

**Before:**
```python
prompt = f"""
CSV Schema:
- Columns: {', '.join(schema.columns)}
- Data Types: {schema.data_types}
"""
```

**After:**
```python
# Enhanced column details with metadata
column_details = []
for col in schema.columns:
    col_info = f"- {col}"
    if schema.data_types and col in schema.data_types:
        col_info += f" ({schema.data_types[col]})"
    if schema.missing_values and col in schema.missing_values:
        missing_count = schema.missing_values[col]
        if missing_count > 0:
            col_info += f" - {missing_count} missing values"
    if schema.unique_counts and col in schema.unique_counts:
        unique_count = schema.unique_counts[col]
        col_info += f" - {unique_count} unique values"
    column_details.append(col_info)

prompt = f"""
ALL AVAILABLE COLUMNS (use these for your query):
{chr(10).join(column_details)}
"""
```

### 3. Comprehensive Column Mapping (`src/ai/csv_reasoning_engine.py`)

**Before:**
```python
prompt = f"""
For each concept in the user query, identify the most relevant CSV columns.
"""
```

**After:**
```python
prompt = f"""
For each concept in the user query, identify ALL relevant CSV columns that might be useful. Consider:
1. Direct matches (e.g., "salary" → "SALARY" column)
2. Synonyms and related terms (e.g., "name" → "FIRST_NAME", "LAST_NAME", "FULL_NAME")
3. Contextual relevance (e.g., "employee info" → all employee-related columns)
4. Data relationships (e.g., "project details" → project name, dates, status, etc.)
5. Supporting information (e.g., "salary" → also include department, position, hire date for context)

Be comprehensive - include columns that might provide additional context or supporting information.
"""
```

### 4. Intelligent Column Selection (`src/ai/reasoning_engine.py`)

**Before:**
```python
select_columns = analysis.get("select_columns", columns[:5])
```

**After:**
```python
# Enhanced column selection logic
additional_columns = []
for col in columns:
    col_lower = col.lower()
    # Check for direct matches
    if any(term in col_lower for term in query_lower.split()):
        if col not in select_columns:
            additional_columns.append(col)
    # Check for common patterns
    elif any(pattern in query_lower for pattern in ["name", "person", "employee"]) and any(name_term in col_lower for name_term in ["name", "first", "last", "full"]):
        if col not in select_columns:
            additional_columns.append(col)
    # ... more pattern matching

select_columns.extend(additional_columns)
```

### 5. Enhanced CSV Identification (`src/ai/reasoning_engine.py`)

**Before:**
```python
description = f"Table: {csv_info['file_path']}, Columns: {', '.join(columns)}"
```

**After:**
```python
# Enhanced description with more column details
column_details = []
for col in columns:
    col_detail = col
    if "column_types" in schema and col in schema["column_types"]:
        col_detail += f" ({schema['column_types'][col]})"
    if "unique_counts" in schema and col in schema["unique_counts"]:
        col_detail += f" [{schema['unique_counts'][col]} unique]"
    column_details.append(col_detail)

description = f"Table: {csv_info['file_path']}\nColumns: {', '.join(column_details)}\nTotal Columns: {len(columns)}"
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Complete Column Visibility**
- All columns are now visible to the AI model during searches
- Comprehensive schema information including data types, unique counts, and missing values
- Enhanced column descriptions with metadata

### 2. **Intelligent Column Selection**
- Pattern-based column matching for related concepts
- Context-aware column expansion
- Support for synonyms and related terms

### 3. **Enhanced SQL Generation**
- More comprehensive SQL queries that include relevant columns
- Better WHERE clause generation with proper column quoting
- Improved ORDER BY and GROUP BY clause handling

### 4. **Better Schema Analysis**
- Multiple document sampling for comprehensive schema extraction
- Metadata aggregation from multiple sources
- Enhanced column type and statistics information

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_column_visibility.py`) has been created to demonstrate the improvements:

```bash
python test_column_visibility.py
```

This script:
1. Uploads a comprehensive CSV with 18 columns
2. Tests various queries to show all columns are accessible
3. Demonstrates enhanced SQL query generation
4. Shows improved column mapping and selection

## Example Improvements

### Before (Limited Column Visibility):
```sql
SELECT "first_name", "last_name", "salary" FROM csv_data WHERE "first_name" LIKE "%John%" LIMIT 20
```

### After (Comprehensive Column Visibility):
```sql
SELECT "first_name", "last_name", "full_name", "email", "phone", "department", "position", "salary", "bonus", "hire_date", "manager", "location" FROM csv_data WHERE "first_name" LIKE "%John%" OR "full_name" LIKE "%John%" LIMIT 20
```

## Benefits

1. **More Complete Answers**: Queries now return all relevant information
2. **Better Context**: Supporting columns provide additional context
3. **Improved Accuracy**: AI model has full visibility of available data
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: More comprehensive and useful responses
5. **Better Data Utilization**: All available columns are considered during searches

## Future Enhancements

1. **Column Relationship Mapping**: Automatically detect relationships between columns
2. **Dynamic Column Weighting**: Weight columns based on relevance to specific query types
3. **Column Usage Analytics**: Track which columns are most useful for different query types
4. **Semantic Column Clustering**: Group related columns for better query generation

## Conclusion

These improvements ensure that the CSV reasoning system now has complete visibility of all available columns during searches, leading to more comprehensive and accurate SQL queries and better user experience. The system now properly leverages the full schema information that was already being captured during the initial AI analysis phase.
